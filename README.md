## Bash Profile 
This is just the bash profile I been using for a while.  I been just copying from machine to machine via usb/email etc.  Just had to setup a new machine and though I make it easier to keep up with changes across different machines if it was in a repo.

To install clone this repo then run:

`./setup`

The setup script sources the profile here without replacing your current profile.  If updates are made just need to pull the changes and new instances of the terminal will have the changes without running setup again.

Mainly used this on OSX, not sure how well it work on other machines.  I sourced some files from Xcode so until I source these files directly it wont be very compatible outside of OSX.
